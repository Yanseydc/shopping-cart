# Shopping Cart

👋🏽 Hello there 

This is a practice that I made with react to improve my knowledge about:

- useContext hook
- useMemo hook
- useReduce hook
- Custom hooks

And I wanted to share with you this practice.

Also I added localStorage functionality in order to persist data in the page.

This practice was provided by this repo
